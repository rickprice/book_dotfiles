## What's in there?

My config for my Mouseless Development Environment.
I am using the lightweight and effective combo:

* arch linux
* i3 / dmenu / dunst
* Neovim
* tmux
* [zsh](https://thevaluable.dev/zsh-install-configure/) / [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* git / [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)

All my config files are in this repository except:

* My development project configurations
* My config install settings

Those files are private and are on my private cloud (using [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)).

## WARNING

There are no backup system. If you install this on top of your dotfiles, expect a big mess.
You shouldn't use the `install.sh` script. You should only pick whatever you want and include it in your own config.
Testing git.
